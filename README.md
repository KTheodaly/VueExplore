# VueExplore

## A first Vue app!

Trying to gain familiarity with Vue as it is a lean front end framework

## What does it do?

This app uses a vue instance to render data and methods using Vue.js

## How does it work?

An instance holds data we can dynamically import to the dom with vue. js, the method is the greeting which also has access to the data, which makes it possible to render the name in the greeting function.

Data binding allows a link to Linkedin to be displayed in the dom

The application handles simple events, by listening for clicks on the dom we can add or subract

## Future development

I'd like to learn how to do more with methods and we could write some more inticate cases to display different sets of information depending on what we wanted.

## What does it accomplish

This was helpful to see the syntax for calling data and methods in Vue.js
