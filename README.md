# VueExplore

## A first Vue app!

Trying to gain familiarity with Vue as it is a lean front end framework

## What does it do?

This app uses a vue instance to render data and methods using Vue.js

## How does it work?

An instance holds data we can dynamically import to the dom with vue. js, the method is the greeting which also has access to the data, which makes it possible to render the name in the greeting function.

Data binding allows a link to Linkedin to be displayed in the dom

The application handles events, by listening for clicks on the dom we can add or subract


## What did I learn

This was helpful to see the syntax for calling data and methods in Vue.js
Databinding
For events, you can use v-on or @ as selectors
Modifiers for events can specify how the application listens for events, such as only allowing a user to double their age once
User interactions, the application takes a user input, the nickname.
Modifiers for user interactions can be chained, for example to enter a favorite quote, the user must click alt + enter, which is useful functionality if you were firing code off whenever a user filled a form field and clicked tab or something like that. Any type of event/function based on a specific user action.

## Future Development

Not all the functionality really matches player profile, it would be ideal to manipulate it to be a bit more cohesive, but it serves thepurpose of learning new methods in Vue.js. Future development would be interesting to see what else I can do with data binding, it's pretty simplistic here.
